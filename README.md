# Smashing Redesign Issues
Reporting bugs and weird issues on the shiny new [Smashing Magazine](https://next.smashingmagazine.com/).

As it is always the case with an open beta, there are still a good number of bugs to be smashed, and we are on it. We could use your help to find and fix all of those nasty bugs before the main release. Thank you for your kind time, patience and efforts — we'll do our best to reply to every single request. You rock!
